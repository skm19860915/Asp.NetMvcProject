            Retrieves an authorization token for additional calls to the Web API
            Note, this is a "Post" because using GET for sensitive data is a bad idea for several reasons:
            1.) Mostly HTTP referrer leakage (an external image in the target page might leak the password[1])
            2.) Password will be stored in server logs (which is obviously bad)
            3.) History caches in browsers
            
            [1] Although I need to note that RFC states that browser should not send referrers from HTTPS to HTTP. But that doesn't mean a bad 3rd party browser toolbar or an external image/flash from an HTTPS site won't leak it.
